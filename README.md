# Pokémon Yellow Kaizo

This game would not be made without everyone credited for help making it, as well as testing it and playing it. Features of this game and
credits are below.

If you are reading this and are considering playing this game, thank you and Enjoy.

Can download by clicking on the folder and downloading each file/patch, or go into releases and download everything from a zip file at once.

Welcome to Yellow Kaizo. Yellow Kaizo is a remaster and upgrade QOL version to the legendary Blue Kaizo. It is designed to feel like Blue Kaizo, but be much more fun, harder and improving on quality of life features throughout the course of the game. The mazes
are back, the trainers are more difficult, items can't be used in battle, and if you think you are up for a challenge, then play the game on the hardcore setting.
